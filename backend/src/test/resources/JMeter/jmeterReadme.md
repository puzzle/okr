# JMeter

### Setup

* Start JMeter
* Import tts.jmx file
* Start
* See analytics
* Run multiple times to increase data

### What it does 
1 Run produces 1 Objective with 5 Keyresults and 5 Check-ins for each Keyresult.
Its is set up to run 100 Times.
The Counter starts at 1000 to match the sequence of the Database.

### Conclusion of this test
If you let it run for a couple of times the request will still be finished in a reasonable time, that's why we don't index.
Maybe there are other cases we didn't test that would make indexing worth.
